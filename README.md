JawaScript is a minimized subset of JavaScript. It consists of a Java-based parser and
an Android executive engine. (iOS executive is under development.) Its goal is to provide
a dynamic scripting environment for mobile APPs with a minimal size overhead. Currently,
the size of the Android executive is less than 20K.

The executive engine is a LOW-performance interpreter executing the AST generated by the
parser. So, don't use it in time-critical routines.

An adequate description for the syntax of JawaScript is "type-less C." For the size
constraint many JavaScript features are excluded from JawaScript:

* No literal template
* No unicode support in identifier
* No complex identifier
* No spread operator
* No regular expression
* No octal string
* 0x2028 and 0x2029 are treated indifferently from ordinary characters
* No unicode character in string literal
* Support only \{x, u, r, n, t, v} in string escaping
* No exception handling (try, catch, throw, finally)
* No yield nor generator
* No class, super, extends
* No const
* No export, import
* No debugger
* No <!-- , --> comment
* No switch
* No this
* No eval

* No directive prologues
* No unnamed functions
* No ... in parameters
* No default value in parameters
* No nested function declaration
* No labeled statement
* No anonymous function
* No arrow function
* No new.target
